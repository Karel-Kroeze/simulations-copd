# simulations-copd
scripts used for simulations of multdimensional and psuedo-unidimensional CAT-COPD.

## provided for reference
These scripts are provided for reference, and will not work without the associated response data and 
item parameter calibrations. In addition, they rely heavily on the ShadowCAT package, found at
github.com/Karel-Kroeze/ShadowCAT.

For access to response data and item calibrations, please contact k.a.kroeze@utwente.nl
